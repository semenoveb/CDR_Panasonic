OpenScape Voice V8
A Call Detail Record (CDR) is a collection of information for each call that is
processed by OpenScape Voice. More complex call scenarios such as transfer,
conference, networking, and other OpenScape Voice features may produce
multiple CDRs.
OpenScape Voice generates and maintains CDRs for usage collection and billing
purposes. The UCE maintains CDR information in the active call context, which
can follow the call from process to process and, in a redundant system, from node
to node.

This script create csv table for billing. Durations round up in minutes.
